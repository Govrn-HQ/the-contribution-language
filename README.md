# Contribution Language Research Project

üèóÔ∏è STATUS - Brainworking | This document should evolve!

## The tl;dr üìé

**What are we creating? üõ†**

A research group to analyze the reported contributions of DAO contributors to build a Contribution Language Framework

**Why are we doing this? üåû**

We want to be able to empower contributors with the ability to easily contribute to any DAO (or the eco-system at large) and have their contributions apply to any and all DAOs.

We want to be able to understand the actual contributions that make up the eco-system, and put the focus on the contributor.

Creating the Language of Contributions empowers contributors to be free and sovereign.

**The Objective üéØ**

Create an open standardized framework and language that contributors can use to explain or report the contributions they make.

We hope that this framework can be used not just by contributors to contribute to DAOs, but integrated in DAOs themself for the DAO to better work with contributors.

## Context üîñ

As we started to build out Govrn, we realiezd that many DAOs don't know what are the atomic contributions that make up a DAO. Further, there is no one place that contributors can point to saying what there contributions are.

We think this is a problem, we beliieve that DAOs are defined by the contributor contributions that make them up.

As we started the journey to understand these contributions, we realized there is no unverisal language or way to report the contributions.

## The Action ‚õ∑

We saw that there is a unique opportunitiy to try understand **all** the contributions that just don't make up a DAO, but the eco-system at large.

More importantly, by understanding and analyzng these contributions, we can start to find similarities in not just what are the most common or impactful contributions, but actually find similarities in how individuals describe these contributions.

From there, we can actually start to build a **The Language of Contributions**.

- By running analysis and clustering, we can start to build the framework of how people actually contribute, and a common way for contribtions

## What is **The Language of Contributions**? üß™

The Language of Contributions is a univeral framework and language that aims to create discrete phrases (or functions) that can cover or explain 99% of the contributions a contributor makes.

The same way a software language creates a framework to communicate the code a developer is contributing, we believe a Language of Contributions will enable DAO contributors to show the tangible contributions they're making to their community.

This language is needed if we ever want to be able to allow contributors to transact in contributions rather than money.
