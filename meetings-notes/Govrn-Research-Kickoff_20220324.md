# Govrn Research Kick-off Notes

## Agenda
1. Intros
2. Project Context
3. Discussion on the project
4. Next Steps

## Notes: 

The problem:  Creating an ontological language to allow people to describe and 

Michael:  Would like to distill the source of the contribution graph
- Need a relational object, that is contextual, that both shows the contribution and the artifact itself

The value is being realized, but the ability to describe and represent it isn't being done
- The value loop isn't being realized

Example: I'm going into a DAO and doing the thing, and the fact of doing the thing actual creates the map of contributions themself
- This map itself can become the framework that we actually give the rewards on

**Challenges:**
1. Putting things that are subjective into objective squares
    - There is context in written word that can be lost when you to categorize it
    - If we cut those out, do we impact the value they receive
    - Letter of the rule can always ruin the spirit of the rule
    - We need to have an adaptive layer so that the primitives can always be updating
        - Choosing the langauge still will be a subjective act
    - Two ways to adapt
        - Fork
        - Evolve

Callout:  Using standard data structure that is adaptable and able to evolve.

Approaches:
1. Structuring Language
2. Creating Categories 
    - What are the categories of conrtibutions?

**Goals:**
1. Would like the actual docmentation and distillation of the contribution graphs and research of the work.
2. Goal of language -> balance expressiveness with standardization

## Next Steps
Govrn to create a summary:
1. Here's what we know so far
    1. Our theory of contirbutions
    2. Data of contirbutions
    3. The process we're about to embark on
    4. How are we collecting the data
5. What you did
6. Why you didsd
7. Mental Models
